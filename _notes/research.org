- “Back in the 20th century, if a program had a bug, that was bad, the program
  might crash, so be it,” said Andrew Appel, professor of computer science at
  Princeton University and a leader in the program verification field. But in

  the program and steal all your data. It’s gone from being a bug that’s bad but
  tolerable to a vulnerability, which is much worse,” he said.\\
